For 1NF:
we make a separate table containing:
orderId, date, customerId, customerName, City;
and make the initial table containing:
orderId, itemId, itemName,quant,price;

For 2NF:
we keep the table:
orderId, date, customerId, customerName, City;
we make a table for:
itemId, itemName,price;
and make the initial table:
orderId,itemId,quant;

For 3NF:
we make a separate table containing:
customerId, customerName, City;
so the first table becomes:
orderId, date, customerId;
and we keep:
itemId, itemName, price;
orderId, itemId, quant;
